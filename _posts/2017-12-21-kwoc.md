title: Winters well spent, KWoC 2017
---

December 2017 was a wonderful month, full of learning while enjoying at home. Having missed out on the first edition of KWoC, planning out my vacations this year didn't require too much thought. My github activites had hitherto been limited to pushing my own content. I was eagerly awaiting this opportunity to try my hand at some real open-sourcing.  

I have always believed that Open Sourcing is an essential skill for any college-going student. Not only does it improve your coding prowess but most importantly, it helps you grasp how organisations function. Only when you work on a big project involving hundreds of people does the developer inside you feel satisfied. So there you have it! My motivation for participating in this event.  

After finishing with my endsemester exams, I went home and started browsing through the projects. _Python_, _algorithms_, _web scraping_ and _machine learning_ were the tools in my modest skillset. Hence, these formed the keywords for extracting out the projects I could contribute to. Let me just provide an overview of the contributions I made.  

I worked on a total of four projects:  
+ [**Titanic Survival Exploration**](https://github.com/prateekiiest/titanic_survival_exploration)  
Titanic Survival Exploration is actually a Kaggle "Getting Started" Competition. In this project, I demonstrated how different features affected a passenger's survival chances during the Titanic sinkage. Data visualization is an indispensable component of any kind of data analysis. Therefore, my contributions included detailed insightful plots.  

+ [**Code-Sleep-Python**](http://github.com/prateekiiest/Code-Sleep-Python)  
This Project contains a number of interesting and fun Python programs. I corrected and enhanced some code and provided documentation for the same.

+ [**Algorithms**](http://github.com/codeIIEST/Algorithms)  
This repository contains almost all data structures and algorithms that any student could possibly need. Since most of the implementations had already been done by others, I added the _readme_ providing explanation for the algorithms.

+ [**ML-Starter-Pack**](https://github.com/aribis369/ML-Starter-Pack)  
I added a few popular machine learning algorithm implementations written from scratch.

Following is the list of the Pull Requests I created (totalling 14):
+ **Titanic Survival Exploration**
  - [_Adding relative feature importance_](https://github.com/prateekiiest/titanic_survival_exploration/pull/20)
  - [_Adding pclass plots_](https://github.com/prateekiiest/titanic_survival_exploration/pull/16)
  - [_Adding illustration for age_](https://github.com/prateekiiest/titanic_survival_exploration/pull/14)
  - [_Added folder for extracted features_](https://github.com/prateekiiest/titanic_survival_exploration/pull/10)

  - [_Updated sorting readme_](https://github.com/codeIIEST/Algorithms/pull/173)  
  
+ **ML-Starter-Pack**
  - [_KNN classification_](https://github.com/aribis369/ML-Starter-Pack/pull/27)
  - [SVM](https://github.com/aribis369/ML-Starter-Pack/pull/21)
  - [_Added linear regression_](https://github.com/aribis369/ML-Starter-Pack/pull/9)

-------
[@prateekiiest](https://github.com/prateekiiest) mentored me for the first three projects. He was supportive and provided useful feedback.  
I am grateful to **KOSS** for taking up this initiative. I wish I had participated in the first edition of KWoC for then I would have been confident of getting selected for GSoC. Nonetheless, it is better late than never!

Result update (19th March 2018):
I successfully passed the final evaluation and received my [Participation Certificate](https://imvivekgupta.github.io/images/KWoC%20Students%20Certificate120.jpg) :)
